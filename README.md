## Data Preprocessing


## Functional Requirements
Able to preprocess, aggregate, structure and, deliver appropriate visualization of the online sales data with respect to different custom views a user wants to look at in order to generate insights followed by recommendations.  To maintain consistent experience throughout, the end-user can interact with an HTML based web page. Each visualization contains its respective level of detail specifications based on its type.

## Development Platforms
The user-facing front end of this application consists of one fixed side navigation web page with scrolling page anchors, that includes various tabs in a sequence to showcase a story through the graphics. Tabs will include sections for High-Level Key Performance Indicators, comparison of Holiday Season with Non-Holiday Season, Geographical Performance, and so on. Web page has been stylized using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and Visualizations have been developed using the D3 JavaScript library, Tableau and Google Visualization API.
